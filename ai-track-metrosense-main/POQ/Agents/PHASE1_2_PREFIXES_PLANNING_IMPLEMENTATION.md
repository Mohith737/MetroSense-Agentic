      "text": "You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5. You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use markdown links (not inline code) for clickable files.\n  * Each file reference should have a stand-alone path; use inline code for non-clickable paths (for example, directories).\n  * For clickable/openable file references, the path target must be an absolute filesystem path. Labels may be short (for example, `[app.ts](/abs/path/app.ts)`).\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"

        "text": "<permissions instructions>\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: - [\"gh\"]\n- [\"mvn\"]\n- [\"temporal-sql-tool\"]\n- [\"./scripts/seed-local.sh\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"ci\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\"]\n- [\"git\", \"add\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"lock\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"sync\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"test\"]\n- [\"prek\", \"run\"]\n- [\"sleep\", \"20\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"ps\"]\n- [\"git\", \"commit\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"exec\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"logs\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"import\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"local.db\"]\n- [\"ruff\", \"format\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"install\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"images\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"auth\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"curl\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\"]\n- [\"python3\", \"scripts/digio_mock_manual_test.py\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"mypy\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"lint\"]\n- [\"ruff\", \"check\", \".\"]\n- [\"git\", \"commit\", \"-m\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"test.db\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"pytest\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"install\", \"-D\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"alembic\"]\n- [\"git\", \"checkout\", \"-b\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"config\", \"set\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"tool\", \"install\"]\n- [\"git\", \"fetch\", \"origin\"]\n- [\"git\", \"reset\", \"--hard\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"rm\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"run\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \"bed-ledger\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"stop\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"apt-get\", \"update\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"lint-imports\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \".pytest_cache\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"apt-get\", \"install\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"env\", \"activate\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"version\"]\n- [\"npx\", \"playwright\", \"install\"]\n- [\"sed\", \"-n\", \"/app:/,/^[^ ]/p\"]\n- [\"SKIP_TEMPORAL_LIVE=1\", \"prek\", \"run\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps eww -p 288506\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna/server/test.db\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna/server/local.db\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"> /tmp/agents_proxy.log\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"agents/metrosense_agent/prompts.py\"]\n- [\"git\", \"reset\", \"plans/STEP1_FOUNDATION_CHANGES.md\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'adk api_server'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'adk api_server' || true\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.main:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'uvicorn app.main:app' || true\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8020/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8020/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://localhost:8020/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'uvicorn app.proxy:app' || true\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"tee\", \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/health\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \"client/test-results/auth-flow-signup-chat-logout-flow\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"sleep 1 && ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/agents && uv sync\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'adk api_server|uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8020/openapi.json | head -n 5\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8021/openapi.json | head -n 40\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense && docker compose up -d db\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna-lalit/bed-ledger/server/app/db/migrations/versions/*.py\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv sync --all-extras\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv run alembic current -v\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv run alembic upgrade head\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"tr '\\\\0' '\\\\n' < /proc/288506/environ | rg -n 'AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN|ADK_BASE_URL'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run alembic upgrade head\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && if [ -f .env ];

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: - [\"gh\"]\n- [\"mvn\"]\n- [\"temporal-sql-tool\"]\n- [\"./scripts/seed-local.sh\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"ci\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\"]\n- [\"git\", \"add\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"lock\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"sync\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"test\"]\n- [\"prek\", \"run\"]\n- [\"sleep\", \"20\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"ps\"]\n- [\"git\", \"commit\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"exec\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"logs\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"import\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"local.db\"]\n- [\"ruff\", \"format\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"install\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"images\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"auth\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"curl\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\"]\n- [\"python3\", \"scripts/digio_mock_manual_test.py\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"mypy\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"lint\"]\n- [\"ruff\", \"check\", \".\"]\n- [\"git\", \"commit\", \"-m\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"test.db\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"pytest\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"install\", \"-D\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"alembic\"]\n- [\"git\", \"checkout\", \"-b\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"config\", \"set\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"tool\", \"install\"]\n- [\"git\", \"fetch\", \"origin\"]\n- [\"git\", \"reset\", \"--hard\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"rm\"]\n- [\"pnpm\", \"run\", \"test:e2e\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \"bed-ledger\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"stop\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"apt-get\", \"update\"]\n- [\"uv\", \"run\", \"lint-imports\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \".pytest_cache\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"apt-get\", \"install\"]\n- [\"./cli/dna\", \"env\", \"activate\"]\n- [\"docker\", \"compose\", \"version\"]\n- [\"npx\", \"playwright\", \"install\"]\n- [\"sed\", \"-n\", \"/app:/,/^[^ ]/p\"]\n- [\"SKIP_TEMPORAL_LIVE=1\", \"prek\", \"run\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps eww -p 288506\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna/server/test.db\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna/server/local.db\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"> /tmp/agents_proxy.log\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"agents/metrosense_agent/prompts.py\"]\n- [\"git\", \"reset\", \"plans/STEP1_FOUNDATION_CHANGES.md\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'adk api_server'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'adk api_server' || true\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.main:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'uvicorn app.main:app' || true\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8020/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8020/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://localhost:8020/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"pkill -f 'uvicorn app.proxy:app' || true\"]\n- [\"sudo\", \"tee\", \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/health\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8021/list-apps\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:8010/api/health\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-rf\", \"client/test-results/auth-flow-signup-chat-logout-flow\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"sleep 1 && ps -ef | rg -n 'uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/agents && uv sync\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"ps -ef | rg -n 'adk api_server|uvicorn app.proxy:app'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8020/openapi.json | head -n 5\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8021/openapi.json | head -n 40\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense && docker compose up -d db\"]\n- [\"rm\", \"-f\", \"/home/dell/dna-lalit/bed-ledger/server/app/db/migrations/versions/*.py\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv sync --all-extras\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv run alembic current -v\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && uv run alembic upgrade head\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"tr '\\\\0' '\\\\n' < /proc/288506/environ | rg -n 'AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN|ADK_BASE_URL'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run alembic upgrade head\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"cd /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/server && if [ -f .env ];

Auth flow, backend-to-agent routing, and database schema are functional. Data seeding, custom agent tools, risk cards/artifacts, streaming, and message persistence are planned.\n\n## Canonical Architecture\n- The intended request flow is:\n  - `frontend -> backend -> agent`\n- The frontend should never call the agent service directly.\n- `server/` is the only public API boundary for browser clients.\n- `agents/` is an internal service boundary responsible for agent runtime behavior, tool usage, and structured chat output generation.\n- If existing docs still use `agent/` singular, treat that as referring to the planned `agents/` subsystem until naming is aligned across the repo.\n\n## Why This Boundary Exists\n- Keep secrets, database access, internal tools, and agent infrastructure off the public internet.\n- Let the backend own request validation, session coordination, auth, rate limiting, logging, and response shaping.\n- Preserve a stable frontend contract even if the agent framework, prompting strategy, or toolchain changes.\n- Keep observability and failure handling centralized in the backend rather than split between browser and agent server.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic, PostgreSQL 16, Loguru, `uv`\n- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, MUI v6, React Query, Zustand, Axios, `pnpm`\n- Tooling: Ruff, MyPy strict, import-linter, ESLint, Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions\n\n## Repository Shape\n- `client/`\n  - Chat UI, streaming presentation, structured response rendering, browser-facing state management.\n- `server/`\n  - Public HTTP API, request validation, orchestration, session handling, backend-to-agent coordination.\n- `agents/`\n  - Internal agent service for chat generation, tool calls, retrieval, and domain intelligence.\n- `server/app/api/`\n  - FastAPI routes and request/response boundaries.\n- `server/app/services/`\n  - Backend business logic and internal orchestration code.\n- `server/app/db/`\n  - Database models, metadata, and session management.\n- `server/tests/unit/`\n  - Fast isolated tests for backend logic and simple route behavior.\n- `server/tests/integration/`\n  - App-level and database-backed tests.\n- `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`\n  - Source of truth for the planned MetroSense chat UX and structured response behavior.\n\n## Architectural Rules\n- Preserve backend layering:\n  - `app.api` may depend on `app.services` and `app.core`\n  - `app.services` may depend on `app.db` and `app.core`\n  - `app.db` must not depend on `app.services` or `app.api`\n- Keep the frontend focused on rendering and interaction, not business orchestration.\n- Route all browser chat traffic through `server/`, even after `agents/` exists.\n- Treat backend-to-agent communication as an internal interface that may evolve without breaking the UI.\n- Prefer extending existing `server/` and `client/` entrypoints over introducing duplicate service layers or alternative public APIs.\n\n## Authentication\n- Public endpoints:\n  - `POST /api/auth/signup`\n  - `POST /api/auth/login`\n- Protected endpoints:\n  - All other `/api/*` routes require a valid JWT cookie.\n- `/health` remains public for uptime checks.\n\n## Product Direction\n- MetroSense is intended to be a chat-first application for weather risk, flooding, AQI, outage, traffic, and infrastructure-readiness questions.\n- Expected response modes:\n  - streamed assistant text for most responses\n  - agent-emitted `RiskCard` payloads for structured neighborhood risk outputs\n  - agent-emitted `Artifact` payloads for charts, maps, tables, or other visual responses\n- Structured outputs should be decided by the agent layer and delivered through the backend to the frontend.\n- The frontend must render structured responses based on explicit backend/agent event types, not keyword inference.\n\n## Testing And Validation\n- Backend checks from `server/`:\n  - `uv sync --all-extras`\n  - `uv run ruff format --check .`\n  - `uv run ruff check .`\n  - `uv run mypy .`\n  - `uv run lint-imports`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/unit -q`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/integration -q`\n- Agents checks from `agents/`:\n  - `uv sync`\n  - `uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py`\n- Frontend checks from `client/`:\n  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`\n  - `pnpm run lint`\n  - `pnpm run build`\n  - `pnpm exec playwright install`\n  - `pnpm run test:e2e`\n- Local startup today:\n  - The agents service runs behind a lightweight proxy that enforces the `X-Internal-Token` shared secret. The backend calls the proxy on port 8020, and the proxy forwards to the ADK server on port 8021. `/health` stays public for simple availability checks.\n  - `docker-compose up -d db`\n  - `cd server && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8010`\n  - `cd agents && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run adk api_server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8021 .`\n  - `cd agents && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run uvicorn app.proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8020`\n  - `cd agents && uv run adk web --port 8001` (optional UI)\n  - `cd client && pnpm install && pnpm run dev`\n- When expanding `agents/`, keep startup and validation commands updated in this file.\n\n## Current Coverage And Next-Step Expectations\n\n### Implemented (✅)\n- **Backend:** Auth flow (signup/login/logout/me with JWT + httponly cookies), health checks, database schema (9+ models for weather/AQI/flooding/outages/traffic), `/api/chat` endpoint\n- **Backend-to-Agent:** Proxy service with `X-Internal-Token` validation, session routing to ADK\n- **Frontend:** Chat UI (MessageBubble, MessageList, InputBar), auth context (login/signup/logout), RiskCard and ArtifactRenderer components, health polling\n- **Tests:** Auth flow (signup/login/logout), password hashing, health checks, basic chat endpoint\n\n### Planned (📋)\n- **Agent Tools:** Custom tools for flood-risk assessment, AQI lookup, outage status, traffic conditions, document retrieval\n- **Data Seeding:** Load CSV data (DataSet_MetroSense/) and documents (Documents_Metrosense/) into database\n- **Structured Responses:** Risk cards and artifacts emitted by agent layer; backend extracts and shapes for frontend\n- **Streaming:** Server-sent events (SSE) or WebSocket for streamed text responses\n- **Message Persistence:** Store chat history in database; load conversation context for agents\n- **Chat Response Tests:** Extend coverage for agent output parsing, risk card generation, artifact rendering\n\n### Current Test Coverage\n- Backend: Health, auth (signup/login/logout/me), password hashing, basic chat routing\n- Frontend: Component renders (no E2E tests written yet)\n- Agents: smoke_test.py validates proxy routing only (not domain logic)\n\n### Next Steps (Recommended Order)\n1. Implement data loader to seed MetroSense CSVs and documents\n2. Add custom agent tools (flood-risk, aqi-lookup, outage-status, traffic)\n3. Implement structured response generation (risk cards/artifacts from agent)\n4. Add message history persistence and context retrieval\n5. Implement streaming responses (SSE or WebSocket)\n6. Extend test coverage for full end-to-end flows\n\n## Agent Guidance\n- Before major implementation work, verify repo truth from `README.md`, `server/pyproject.toml`, `client/package.json`, and `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`.\n- Prefer `rg` for search.\n- Do not document or reference unimplemented services as if they already exist.\n- **Important:** The CSV data files (DataSet_MetroSense/) and documents (Documents_Metrosense/) exist in the repo but are **not yet loaded** into the database. Implement a data loader before building agent tools that depend on MetroSense domain knowledge.\n- The agent service skeleton runs and routes to google_search tool, but custom domain tools (flood-risk, aqi, outage, traffic) do not yet exist. Add tools incrementally as matching backend data becomes available.\n- If current behavior and MetroSense direction diverge, align new work to the MetroSense direction while keeping transitions explicit and incremental.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- google-adk-python: Expert guidance on the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Python. Use this skill when the user asks about building agents, using tools, streaming, callbacks, tutorials, deployment, or advanced architecture with the Google ADK in Python. (file: /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/.agents/skills/google-adk-python/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /home/dell/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/dell/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/dell/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"

Auth flow, backend-to-agent routing, and database schema are functional. Data seeding, custom agent tools, risk cards/artifacts, streaming, and message persistence are planned.\n\n## Canonical Architecture\n- The intended request flow is:\n  - `frontend -> backend -> agent`\n- The frontend should never call the agent service directly.\n- `server/` is the only public API boundary for browser clients.\n- `agents/` is an internal service boundary responsible for agent runtime behavior, tool usage, and structured chat output generation.\n- If existing docs still use `agent/` singular, treat that as referring to the planned `agents/` subsystem until naming is aligned across the repo.\n\n## Why This Boundary Exists\n- Keep secrets, database access, internal tools, and agent infrastructure off the public internet.\n- Let the backend own request validation, session coordination, auth, rate limiting, logging, and response shaping.\n- Preserve a stable frontend contract even if the agent framework, prompting strategy, or toolchain changes.\n- Keep observability and failure handling centralized in the backend rather than split between browser and agent server.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic, PostgreSQL 16, Loguru, `uv`\n- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, MUI v6, React Query, Zustand, Axios, `pnpm`\n- Tooling: Ruff, MyPy strict, import-linter, ESLint, Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions\n\n## Repository Shape\n- `client/`\n  - Chat UI, streaming presentation, structured response rendering, browser-facing state management.\n- `server/`\n  - Public HTTP API, request validation, orchestration, session handling, backend-to-agent coordination.\n- `agents/`\n  - Internal agent service for chat generation, tool calls, retrieval, and domain intelligence.\n- `server/app/api/`\n  - FastAPI routes and request/response boundaries.\n- `server/app/services/`\n  - Backend business logic and internal orchestration code.\n- `server/app/db/`\n  - Database models, metadata, and session management.\n- `server/tests/unit/`\n  - Fast isolated tests for backend logic and simple route behavior.\n- `server/tests/integration/`\n  - App-level and database-backed tests.\n- `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`\n  - Source of truth for the planned MetroSense chat UX and structured response behavior.\n\n## Architectural Rules\n- Preserve backend layering:\n  - `app.api` may depend on `app.services` and `app.core`\n  - `app.services` may depend on `app.db` and `app.core`\n  - `app.db` must not depend on `app.services` or `app.api`\n- Keep the frontend focused on rendering and interaction, not business orchestration.\n- Route all browser chat traffic through `server/`, even after `agents/` exists.\n- Treat backend-to-agent communication as an internal interface that may evolve without breaking the UI.\n- Prefer extending existing `server/` and `client/` entrypoints over introducing duplicate service layers or alternative public APIs.\n\n## Authentication\n- Public endpoints:\n  - `POST /api/auth/signup`\n  - `POST /api/auth/login`\n- Protected endpoints:\n  - All other `/api/*` routes require a valid JWT cookie.\n- `/health` remains public for uptime checks.\n\n## Product Direction\n- MetroSense is intended to be a chat-first application for weather risk, flooding, AQI, outage, traffic, and infrastructure-readiness questions.\n- Expected response modes:\n  - streamed assistant text for most responses\n  - agent-emitted `RiskCard` payloads for structured neighborhood risk outputs\n  - agent-emitted `Artifact` payloads for charts, maps, tables, or other visual responses\n- Structured outputs should be decided by the agent layer and delivered through the backend to the frontend.\n- The frontend must render structured responses based on explicit backend/agent event types, not keyword inference.\n\n## Testing And Validation\n- Backend checks from `server/`:\n  - `uv sync --all-extras`\n  - `uv run ruff format --check .`\n  - `uv run ruff check .`\n  - `uv run mypy .`\n  - `uv run lint-imports`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/unit -q`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/integration -q`\n- Agents checks from `agents/`:\n  - `uv sync`\n  - `uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py`\n- Frontend checks from `client/`:\n  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`\n  - `pnpm run lint`\n  - `pnpm run build`\n  - `pnpm exec playwright install`\n  - `pnpm run test:e2e`\n- Local startup today:\n  - The agents service runs behind a lightweight proxy that enforces the `X-Internal-Token` shared secret.

Auth flow, backend-to-agent routing, and database schema are functional. Data seeding, custom agent tools, risk cards/artifacts, streaming, and message persistence are planned.\n\n## Canonical Architecture\n- The intended request flow is:\n  - `frontend -> backend -> agent`\n- The frontend should never call the agent service directly.\n- `server/` is the only public API boundary for browser clients.\n- `agents/` is an internal service boundary responsible for agent runtime behavior, tool usage, and structured chat output generation.\n- If existing docs still use `agent/` singular, treat that as referring to the planned `agents/` subsystem until naming is aligned across the repo.\n\n## Why This Boundary Exists\n- Keep secrets, database access, internal tools, and agent infrastructure off the public internet.\n- Let the backend own request validation, session coordination, auth, rate limiting, logging, and response shaping.\n- Preserve a stable frontend contract even if the agent framework, prompting strategy, or toolchain changes.\n- Keep observability and failure handling centralized in the backend rather than split between browser and agent server.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic, PostgreSQL 16, Loguru, `uv`\n- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, MUI v6, React Query, Zustand, Axios, `pnpm`\n- Tooling: Ruff, MyPy strict, import-linter, ESLint, Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions\n\n## Repository Shape\n- `client/`\n  - Chat UI, streaming presentation, structured response rendering, browser-facing state management.\n- `server/`\n  - Public HTTP API, request validation, orchestration, session handling, backend-to-agent coordination.\n- `agents/`\n  - Internal agent service for chat generation, tool calls, retrieval, and domain intelligence.\n- `server/app/api/`\n  - FastAPI routes and request/response boundaries.\n- `server/app/services/`\n  - Backend business logic and internal orchestration code.\n- `server/app/db/`\n  - Database models, metadata, and session management.\n- `server/tests/unit/`\n  - Fast isolated tests for backend logic and simple route behavior.\n- `server/tests/integration/`\n  - App-level and database-backed tests.\n- `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`\n  - Source of truth for the planned MetroSense chat UX and structured response behavior.\n\n## Architectural Rules\n- Preserve backend layering:\n  - `app.api` may depend on `app.services` and `app.core`\n  - `app.services` may depend on `app.db` and `app.core`\n  - `app.db` must not depend on `app.services` or `app.api`\n- Keep the frontend focused on rendering and interaction, not business orchestration.\n- Route all browser chat traffic through `server/`, even after `agents/` exists.\n- Treat backend-to-agent communication as an internal interface that may evolve without breaking the UI.\n- Prefer extending existing `server/` and `client/` entrypoints over introducing duplicate service layers or alternative public APIs.\n\n## Authentication\n- Public endpoints:\n  - `POST /api/auth/signup`\n  - `POST /api/auth/login`\n- Protected endpoints:\n  - All other `/api/*` routes require a valid JWT cookie.\n- `/health` remains public for uptime checks.\n\n## Product Direction\n- MetroSense is intended to be a chat-first application for weather risk, flooding, AQI, outage, traffic, and infrastructure-readiness questions.\n- Expected response modes:\n  - streamed assistant text for most responses\n  - agent-emitted `RiskCard` payloads for structured neighborhood risk outputs\n  - agent-emitted `Artifact` payloads for charts, maps, tables, or other visual responses\n- Structured outputs should be decided by the agent layer and delivered through the backend to the frontend.\n- The frontend must render structured responses based on explicit backend/agent event types, not keyword inference.\n\n## Testing And Validation\n- Backend checks from `server/`:\n  - `uv sync --all-extras`\n  - `uv run ruff format --check .`\n  - `uv run ruff check .`\n  - `uv run mypy .`\n  - `uv run lint-imports`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/unit -q`\n  - `uv run pytest tests/integration -q`\n- Agents checks from `agents/`:\n  - `uv sync`\n  - `uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py`\n- Frontend checks from `client/`:\n  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`\n  - `pnpm run lint`\n  - `pnpm run build`\n  - `pnpm exec playwright install`\n  - `pnpm run test:e2e`\n- Local startup today:\n  - The agents service runs behind a lightweight proxy that enforces the `X-Internal-Token` shared secret. The backend calls the proxy on port 8020, and the proxy forwards to the ADK server on port 8021. `/health` stays public for simple availability checks.\n  - `docker-compose up -d db`\n  - `cd server && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8010`\n  - `cd agents && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run adk api_server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8021 .`\n  - `cd agents && export AGENT_INTERNAL_TOKEN=your-internal-token-here && uv run uvicorn app.proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8020`\n  - `cd agents && uv run adk web --port 8001` (optional UI)\n  - `cd client && pnpm install && pnpm run dev`\n- When expanding `agents/`, keep startup and validation commands updated in this file.\n\n## Current Coverage And Next-Step Expectations\n\n### Implemented (✅)\n- **Backend:** Auth flow (signup/login/logout/me with JWT + httponly cookies), health checks, database schema (9+ models for weather/AQI/flooding/outages/traffic), `/api/chat` endpoint\n- **Backend-to-Agent:** Proxy service with `X-Internal-Token` validation, session routing to ADK\n- **Frontend:** Chat UI (MessageBubble, MessageList, InputBar), auth context (login/signup/logout), RiskCard and ArtifactRenderer components, health polling\n- **Tests:** Auth flow (signup/login/logout), password hashing, health checks, basic chat endpoint\n\n### Planned (📋)\n- **Agent Tools:** Custom tools for flood-risk assessment, AQI lookup, outage status, traffic conditions, document retrieval\n- **Data Seeding:** Load CSV data (DataSet_MetroSense/) and documents (Documents_Metrosense/) into database\n- **Structured Responses:** Risk cards and artifacts emitted by agent layer; backend extracts and shapes for frontend\n- **Streaming:** Server-sent events (SSE) or WebSocket for streamed text responses\n- **Message Persistence:** Store chat history in database; load conversation context for agents\n- **Chat Response Tests:** Extend coverage for agent output parsing, risk card generation, artifact rendering\n\n### Current Test Coverage\n- Backend: Health, auth (signup/login/logout/me), password hashing, basic chat routing\n- Frontend: Component renders (no E2E tests written yet)\n- Agents: smoke_test.py validates proxy routing only (not domain logic)\n\n### Next Steps (Recommended Order)\n1. Implement data loader to seed MetroSense CSVs and documents\n2. Add custom agent tools (flood-risk, aqi-lookup, outage-status, traffic)\n3. Implement structured response generation (risk cards/artifacts from agent)\n4. Add message history persistence and context retrieval\n5. Implement streaming responses (SSE or WebSocket)\n6. Extend test coverage for full end-to-end flows\n\n## Agent Guidance\n- Before major implementation work, verify repo truth from `README.md`, `server/pyproject.toml`, `client/package.json`, and `docs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`.\n- Prefer `rg` for search.\n- Do not document or reference unimplemented services as if they already exist.\n- **Important:** The CSV data files (DataSet_MetroSense/) and documents (Documents_Metrosense/) exist in the repo but are **not yet loaded** into the database. Implement a data loader before building agent tools that depend on MetroSense domain knowledge.\n- The agent service skeleton runs and routes to google_search tool, but custom domain tools (flood-risk, aqi, outage, traffic) do not yet exist. Add tools incrementally as matching backend data becomes available.\n- If current behavior and MetroSense direction diverge, align new work to the MetroSense direction while keeping transitions explicit and incremental.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- google-adk-python: Expert guidance on the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Python. Use this skill when the user asks about building agents, using tools, streaming, callbacks, tutorials, deployment, or advanced architecture with the Google ADK in Python. (file: /home/dell/ai-track-metrosense/.agents/skills/google-adk-python/SKILL.md)\n- find-skills: Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like \"how do I do X\", \"find a skill for X\", \"is there a skill that can...\", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill. (file: /home/dell/.agents/skills/find-skills/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/dell/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/dell/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.",

Please note that I was unable to retrieve real-time current weather or lake hydrology data due to a backend connectivity issue. Therefore, this assessment focuses on the established flood vulnerability patterns and thresholds for Bellandur. Bellandur is highly susceptible to flooding primarily due to a **compound flood mechanism**: a combination of direct rainfall (pluvial) and backflow from Bellandur lake. This means that even moderate rainfall can lead to severe inundation, especially when Bellandur lake levels are high. **High-Risk Locations in Bellandur:** * **Bellandur ORR Underpass:** This is identified as a primary failure point due to its undersized box culvert and critically insufficient sump pump capacity. It is also directly impacted by Bellandur lake backflow. * **Agara Junction:** A secondary failure point that typically experiences closure 15–20 minutes after the Bellandur ORR underpass. * **Bellandur Main Road (near State Bank Colony):** This low-lying stretch is prone to surface flooding, with typical depths of 30–45 cm during severe events. **Rainfall and Lake Level Thresholds for Inundation (for sustained rainfall for at least 20 minutes):** The likelihood and severity of flooding are significantly influenced by Bellandur lake's fill level. Here are the thresholds: | Severity | Bellandur Lake ≤ 60% Fill | Bellandur Lake ≥ 70% Fill (Watch) | Bellandur Lake ≥ 82% Fill (Warning) | Bellandur Lake ≥ 92% Fill (Danger) | | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | | **T1 (Inundation Onset)** | 18 mm/hr | 14 mm/hr | 10 mm/hr | 6 mm/hr | | **T2 (Traffic Affected)** | 28 mm/hr | 22 mm/hr | 16 mm/hr | 10 mm/hr | | **T3 (Closure Likely)** | 38 mm/hr | 30 mm/hr | 22 mm/hr | 14 mm/hr | **Important Considerations:** * **Lake Backflow Dominance:** When Bellandur lake is above 94% fill, lake backflow is the primary driver of inundation, contributing 71–89% of observed flood depths. In such conditions, moderate sustained rainfall (e.g., 20 mm/hr for 60 minutes) can be more dangerous than intense but brief downpours. * **Hysteresis Effect:** Even after rainfall stops and lake levels begin to decline, the risk of backflow and inundation persists for 4–8 hours, impeding drainage from underpass sumps. * **Antecedent Rainfall:** Prior rainfall increases flood risk. If 24-hour prior rainfall exceeds 50 mm, all thresholds are reduced by 15%. If 72-hour prior rainfall exceeds 120 mm, all thresholds are reduced by 25%. **Early Warning and Barricade Triggers:** To mitigate flood impact, specific triggers are recommended: * **Bellandur ORR Underpass Barricade Trigger:** * Rainfall intensity ≥ 32 mm/hr sustained for 20+ minutes, OR * Bellandur lake fill ≥ 85% AND rainfall ≥ 18 mm/hr, OR * Sump pump failure alarm is active. * Time to road closure from trigger: 25–40 minutes. * **Pre-emptive Barricading:** If Bellandur lake fill exceeds 95%, pre-emptive barricading of the Bellandur ORR underpass and Agara underpass is recommended, regardless of current rainfall. In summary, Bellandur's flood risk tonight would be determined by a combination of actual rainfall intensity, the current fill level of Bellandur lake, and any recent heavy rainfall. Without real-time data, it's not possible to provide a specific forecast for tonight. However, the documented thresholds highlight that even moderate rainfall can cause significant disruption if the lake is at high fill levels. **Confidence:** Medium (Due to lack of real-time data, but comprehensive understanding of vulnerability from documents). **Data Freshness:** Documents published between 2019 and 2022. **Context Used:** * `bangalore_flood_study_2022` (sections s2, s3, s5) * `drainage_plan_bbmp_2019` (sections s2, s5) **Citations:** 1.

Here are the thresholds: | Severity | Bellandur Lake ≤ 60% Fill | Bellandur Lake ≥ 70% Fill (Watch) | Bellandur Lake ≥ 82% Fill (Warning) | Bellandur Lake ≥ 92% Fill (Danger) | | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | | **T1 (Inundation Onset)** | 18 mm/hr | 14 mm/hr | 10 mm/hr | 6 mm/hr | | **T2 (Traffic Affected)** | 28 mm/hr | 22 mm/hr | 16 mm/hr | 10 mm/hr | | **T3 (Closure Likely)** | 38 mm/hr | 30 mm/hr | 22 mm/hr | 14 mm/hr | **Important Considerations:** * **Lake Backflow Dominance:** When Bellandur lake is above 94% fill, lake backflow is the primary driver of inundation, contributing 71–89% of observed flood depths. In such conditions, moderate sustained rainfall (e.g., 20 mm/hr for 60 minutes) can be more dangerous than intense but brief downpours. * **Hysteresis Effect:** Even after rainfall stops and lake levels begin to decline, the risk of backflow and inundation persists for 4–8 hours, impeding drainage from underpass sumps. * **Antecedent Rainfall:** Prior rainfall increases flood risk. If 24-hour prior rainfall exceeds 50 mm, all thresholds are reduced by 15%. If 72-hour prior rainfall exceeds 120 mm, all thresholds are reduced by 25%. **Early Warning and Barricade Triggers:** To mitigate flood impact, specific triggers are recommended: * **Bellandur ORR Underpass Barricade Trigger:** * Rainfall intensity ≥ 32 mm/hr sustained for 20+ minutes, OR * Bellandur lake fill ≥ 85% AND rainfall ≥ 18 mm/hr, OR * Sump pump failure alarm is active. * Time to road closure from trigger: 25–40 minutes. * **Pre-emptive Barricading:** If Bellandur lake fill exceeds 95%, pre-emptive barricading of the Bellandur ORR underpass and Agara underpass is recommended, regardless of current rainfall. In summary, Bellandur's flood risk tonight would be determined by a combination of actual rainfall intensity, the current fill level of Bellandur lake, and any recent heavy rainfall. Without real-time data, it's not possible to provide a specific forecast for tonight. However, the documented thresholds highlight that even moderate rainfall can cause significant disruption if the lake is at high fill levels. **Confidence:** Medium (Due to lack of real-time data, but comprehensive understanding of vulnerability from documents). **Data Freshness:** Documents published between 2019 and 2022. **Context Used:** * `bangalore_flood_study_2022` (sections s2, s3, s5) * `drainage_plan_bbmp_2019` (sections s2, s5) **Citations:** 1.

However, once flooding begins at Varthur, water depth escalates faster — observed rates of 8–12 cm/hour water rise at Varthur Kodi junction during peak events versus 4–6 cm/hour at Bellandur ORR underpass.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s2.md:64:2.

Marathahalli Bridge approach — affected by ORR backflow during compound events\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s4.md:161:**Logistics planning implication:** For time-critical deliveries during rain events, Mysore Road and Hosur Road (elevated segment) offer the lowest delay risk. KR Puram and Sarjapur Road carry the highest delay risk for any rainfall above 15 mm/hr.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s1.md:34:Roadside kerb drains and cross-drain culverts. These are the first point of failure during intense rainfall events, typically backing up within 15–20 minutes of sustained rainfall above 20 mm/hr.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s1.md:47:When lake fill levels exceed 85%, the retention function is effectively saturated. Rainfall events occurring when lakes are at or above 85% capacity result in rapid overland flow because the lake system can no longer absorb surges. This is the primary mechanism behind flash flooding in Bellandur, Varthur, and KR Puram wards during late monsoon season (August–October), when cumulative fill from earlier rains leaves lakes with minimal buffer capacity.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s1.md:87:| NDMA Flood Reports | Incident records, damage assessments | 2005, 2010, 2015, 2017, 2018 events |\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s3.md:69:This crossing floods at the surface rather than via an underpass mechanism. Water depth at road surface can reach 0.6–0.9m during intense events, sufficient to stall low-clearance vehicles.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s1.md:11:Bengaluru experienced a series of increasingly severe urban flood events between 2015 and 2022. The September 2022 event — in which sustained rainfall of 131 mm over 48 hours caused inundation across 112 residential areas, stranded an estimated 18,000 vehicles, and resulted in 7 flood-related fatalities — was the most severe on record and prompted systematic research into the city's flood vulnerability mechanisms.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s1.md:19:The study does not reproduce flood event timelines or post-mortems. It extracts from those events the thresholds, curves, and risk factors that have predictive value for future events.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s1.md:72:Both mechanisms operating simultaneously.

Main risk is localised from intense short-duration events.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s6.md:152:- **Priority Infrastructure Gap:** Industrial effluent–stormwater separation (combined drain sections cause contamination during overflow events)\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s6.md:153:- **Notes:** Peenya's drainage risk is primarily a water quality risk rather than inundation risk. Industrial chemical contamination of stormwater during overflow events is a documented concern.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s4.md:115:**Observed failure discharge:** 11.8 m³/s (multiple events 2016–2018)  \nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bbmp_tree_canopy_reference_2024_s3.md:50:- > 85 km/h: > 70% probability — mass uprooting events observed in these conditions\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bbmp_tree_canopy_reference_2024_s3.md:82:- Upper crown in large branches during wind events\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bbmp_tree_canopy_reference_2024_s3.md:87:3. **Pre-monsoon squall events** (April–May in Bangalore) produce disproportionate Silver Oak failures compared to Rain Trees\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s5.md:16:No single signal stream is sufficient. A system that monitors only rainfall will miss compound events at moderate rainfall intensity. A system that monitors only lake levels will miss rapid pluvial events during low-fill periods.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s3.md:35:**Key finding:** At fill above 94%, Bellandur lake backflow is the dominant inundation driver. Rainfall provides only 11–29% of the observed flood depth. This means that extremely intense but brief rainfall events (e.g., 60 mm/hr for 10 minutes) are less dangerous than moderate sustained rainfall (20 mm/hr for 60 minutes) when the lake is above 94% fill, because the lake backflow mechanism requires sustained inflow, not peak intensity.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s3.md:93:**Cascade timing analysis based on 8 observed events:**\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s3.md:109:The following table shows estimated probability of a flood incident (T2 or above inundation at the primary at-risk location) given joint rainfall intensity and lake fill conditions. Probabilities are based on empirical incident rate analysis from 94 verified events.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s2.md:10:This analysis covers 1,847 unplanned outage events recorded between 2018 and 2022 within BBMP limits. Of these, 624 (33.8%) were attributed to treefall — the single largest fault category ahead of conductor failure (21%), transformer failure (18%), and lightning (14%).\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s2.md:30:**Primary failure mode:** Whole-tree uprooting (shallow, wide root plate) during sustained wind events; branch shed at lower gusts\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s2.md:39:| > 80 | > 55% | **Critical risk** — mass treefall events observed historically |\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s2.md:41:**Soil moisture modifier:** Rain Tree uprooting probability increases by 30–40% when the event occurs after 48+ hours of cumulative rainfall > 80 mm. Saturated soil dramatically reduces root plate resistance.

BBMP disaster management officers should be able to use the tables in this section directly during active rain events without needing to consult the full technical analysis in Sections 2–4.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s5.md:50:A **compound event** is defined as simultaneous high rainfall intensity AND elevated lake fill. During compound events, risk escalates non-linearly because:\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s2.md:13:The primary flood mechanism along ORR is **dual-source inundation**: rainfall runoff from adjacent residential colonies combines with backflow from the Bellandur–Varthur lake system when lake fill levels exceed 85%. This compound mechanism means that even moderate rainfall events (35–45 mm/hr) can cause severe inundation when lakes are already at high fill during late monsoon months.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s2.md:53:Agara underpass is fed primarily by surface runoff from HSR Layout Sectors 1–3, a densely built residential area with estimated 74% impervious cover. The secondary drain from Sector 2 that connects to the Agara underpass sump was found to be 60% silted during the 2018 inspection, reducing effective inflow capacity to approximately 6.7 m³/s. Combined surface and lateral inflow during heavy events exceeds sump capacity rapidly.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s2.md:75:Silk Board underpass has the highest pump capacity on the ORR corridor and has not experienced complete closure since 2015 improvements. However, it remains at risk during compound events because three contributing drains — from Madiwala, BTM Layout, and the HSR–Koramangala channel — converge at the Silk Board sump. When all three contribute simultaneously at peak discharge, total inflow exceeds combined pump output.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bbmp_tree_canopy_reference_2024_s4.md:13:3. **Historical incident correlation** — BESCOM outage records confirming actual treefall events on segment\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bbmp_tree_canopy_reference_2024_s4.md:129:Based on risk tier and historical incident patterns, BESCOM and BBMP should consider the following pre-storm crew positioning matrix during Alert Level 2 and 3 events:\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:33:- Historical incident rate: 5.5 events/10km/yr — **highest among monitored wards**\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:43:- Historical incident rate: 4.2 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:53:- Historical incident rate: 2.8 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:63:- Historical incident rate: 2.4 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:73:- Historical incident rate: 3.1 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:83:- Historical incident rate: 2.6 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:93:- Historical incident rate: 4.6 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:103:- Historical incident rate: 4.2 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:113:- Historical incident rate: 1.8 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:123:- Historical incident rate: 2.2 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:133:- Historical incident rate: 3.0 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:143:- Historical incident rate: 1.6 events/10km/yr (on treefall specifically)\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:153:- Historical incident rate: 2.6 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:163:- Historical incident rate: 2.4 events/10km/yr\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:173:- Historical incident rate: 4.8 events/10km/yr — **second highest after Bellandur**\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bescom_infra_reference_2023_s4.md:183:- Historical incident rate: 2.2 events/10km/yr\n"

Rainfall events occurring when lakes are at or above 85% capacity result in rapid overland flow because the lake system can no longer absorb surges.

This means that extremely intense but brief rainfall events (e.g., 60 mm/hr for 10 minutes) are less dangerous than moderate sustained rainfall (20 mm/hr for 60 minutes) when the lake is above 94% fill, because the lake backflow mechanism requires sustained inflow, not peak intensity.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s3.md:93:**Cascade timing analysis based on 8 observed events:**\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/bangalore_flood_study_2022_s3.md:109:The following table shows estimated probability of a flood incident (T2 or above inundation at the primary at-risk location) given joint rainfall intensity and lake fill conditions.

During compound events, risk escalates non-linearly because:\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s2.md:13:The primary flood mechanism along ORR is **dual-source inundation**: rainfall runoff from adjacent residential colonies combines with backflow from the Bellandur–Varthur lake system when lake fill levels exceed 85%. This compound mechanism means that even moderate rainfall events (35–45 mm/hr) can cause severe inundation when lakes are already at high fill during late monsoon months.\nserver/Documents_Metrosense/drainage_plan_bbmp_2019_s2.md:53:Agara underpass is fed primarily by surface runoff from HSR Layout Sectors 1–3, a densely built residential area with estimated 74% impervious cover. The secondary drain from Sector 2 that connects to the Agara underpass sump was found to be 60% silted during the 2018 inspection, reducing effective inflow capacity to approximately 6.7 m³/s.

However, it remains at risk during compound events because three contributing drains — from Madiwala, BTM Layout, and the HSR–Koramangala channel — converge at the Silk Board sump.
